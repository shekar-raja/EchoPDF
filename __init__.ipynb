Dietary Sources of Calcium  In the typical American diet, calcium is obtained mostly from dairy  products, primarily cheese. A slice of cheddar or Swiss cheese  contains just over 200 milligrams of calcium. One cup of nonfat milk  contains approximately 300 milligrams of calcium, which is about  a third of the RDA for calcium for most adults. Foods fortified with  calcium such as cereals, soy milk, and orange juice also provide one  third or greater of the calcium RDA. Although the typical American  diet relies mostly on dairy products for obtaining calcium, there are  other good non-dairy sources of calcium.  \\xa0 Calcium  |  625'}]"
