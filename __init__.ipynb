The  difference depends on the agent that causes the condition.  Microbes, such as bacteria, cause food infections, while toxins, such  as the kind produced by molds, cause intoxications. Different  diseases manifest in different ways, so signs and symptoms can  vary with the source of contamination. However the illness occurs,  the microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal  tract, and as a result common symptoms include diarrhea, nausea,  and abdominal pain. Additional symptoms may include vomiting,  dehydration, lightheadedness, and rapid heartbeat. More severe  complications can include a high fever, diarrhea that lasts more than  three days, prolonged vomiting, bloody stools, and signs of shock.  One of the biggest misconceptions about foodborne illness is that  it is always triggered by the last meal that a person ate. However,  it may take several days or more before the onset of symptoms. If  you develop a foodborne illness, you should rest and drink plenty of  fluids. Avoid antidiarrheal medications, because they could slow the  elimination of the contaminant.  Food Infection  According to the CDC, more than 250 different foodborne diseases  992  |  The Major Types of Foodborne Illness'}]"

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease  risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity  level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The  optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of  her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat  mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is  a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but  similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.
